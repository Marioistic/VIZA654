# VIZA 654 - Digital Image
# All files completed Fall 2021
# Department of Visualization, Texas A&M University
# Python 3.9

Each of these files is a different program (or a portion of a larger program)
that can be downloaded and ran to produce the described image(s).
Instructions for running each file can be found within the file, but a few things
to note:

All programs that use more than one (1) image must use images that are the EXACT same size.
If necessary, crop them to the same size but the program will throw an error otherwise.

The first few projects use PPMs instead of JPGs or PNGs, so pay attention to the type of PPM used.
